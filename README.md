## Project Scope

Create a timed quiz using javaScript, HTML, and CSS fundamentals, storing high scores using local storage. 

- The main screen you can see two buttons with "Start Quiz" and "High Scores". Start Quiz button takes user to start the timed quiz. High Scores takes user to the saved high scores page.
- Once user enters quiz they have 60 seconds to complete the quiz, entering incorrect answers deducts 10 seconds from their score. 
- Upon completion of quiz user will be able to save name in the list of high scores.
